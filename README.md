Rationale:
Pollution, especially on beaches, has had a huge effect on humans and animals alike. Global warming and unintentional animal torture have been prominent problems in our lives. To help with this ongoing situation, I aim to build an autonomous waste detection and tracking system that also sorts it by color.

Engineering Goals:
-Gather Materials
-Test each component
    -Test Camera
    -Test Motor
    -Test ultrasonic sensor
-Compile simple object avoidance code with ultrasonic sensor and Motor
-Code tunable camera-color detection
-Code camera-color detection and motor logic

Improvements:
-incorporate ML to associate shapes with colors so that it can generalize what it can collect rather than restricting it to a certain color
